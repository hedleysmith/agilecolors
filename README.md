Useful tools to auto-generate colours in SASS & Compass
-------------------------------------------------------

We can use the power of SASS & Compass to help us auto-generate colour schemes & 
colour pallets. This can be useful for rapid prototyping & designing in the 
browser.

We're using SASS & Compass here. See [Compass Color Helpers](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/helpers/colors/) and [SASS Functions](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/Sass/Script/Functions.html) for reference.

How to use
----------

* First set the $base-color
* Other colour variables are auto-generated based on traditional colour harmonies

Find out about some colour theory [Here](http://www.tigercolor.com/color-lab/color-theory/color-harmonies.htm)

So far we have:

* Complementary 
* Split Complementary
* Triad
* Tetradic

Requirements
------------
* SASS 3.2 or above
* Compass
